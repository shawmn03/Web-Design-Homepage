    <h2>The Deal That Turned Deadly</h2>
    <p><em>1987. Miami. What began as a promising business venture spiraled into a chilling tale of betrayal, greed, and murder.</em></p>

    <details>
      <summary>🧾 Background of the Deal</summary>
      <p>John "JD" Daniels and Mark Veretti were set to revolutionize the VHS distribution market. Their company, Neon Streamline Inc., promised to deliver cult classics and obscure B-movies to the masses.</p>
      <p>But beneath the neon lights and glitzy press events, tensions simmered. Financial records were off, and silent partners began to disappear.</p>

      <summary>💰 The Money Trail</summary>
      <p>A forensic audit uncovered a $2.3 million discrepancy. JD claimed the funds went into marketing. Mark said they never existed. Offshore accounts tied to the Cayman Islands emerged during the investigation.</p>
      <p>Still, no charges were filed — until bodies began turning up.</p>

      <summary>🕵️ The Investigation</summary>
      <p>Detective Rosa Lin began connecting the dots when three former employees were found dead — all staged to look like accidents. One victim was found with a neon pink VHS tape clenched in their hand.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage from a shuttered roller rink became the breakthrough. On it: JD and Mark arguing over a briefcase.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>⚖️ Trial and Fallout</summary>
      <p>The trial drew national attention. JD turned on Mark, revealing audio recordings that implicated him in orchestrating two of the murders.</p>
      <p>Mark was sentenced to life without parole. JD entered witness protection and hasn't been seen since.</p>
